# Online Food Delivery Company Problem (OFDCP)

Starting from the Meal Delivery Routing Problem, a formalization of the food delivery problem proposed by Reyes et al., I reintroduced the problem by adding some features (e.g. new algorithms to batch the orders, possibility for the rider to reject an order, introduction of the queue) and I developed a discrete-event simulator using Python 3.10 to solve the problem. I used OSRM to calculate the shortest path on the graph street and Google OR-Tools to solve the optimization problems.

Requirements: Python 3.10
